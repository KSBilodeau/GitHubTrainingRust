## Lesson 1 - Forking a Project

When you fork a repository, you are making a copy of a person's project for you to edit and push changes to.  This will then allow you to make pull requests to repositories you do not personally own.  Follow these steps to make a fork of this repository:

##### Step 1 - Navigate to the Repository Page:

To begin go to [this repositories page](https://github.com/KSBilodeau/GitHubTrainingRust) (if you are not there already).  It should look like this:

##### Step 2 - Click the Fork Button

Then simply click the fork button as you can see as follows:

You should now see the repository in your repository list:

## Lesson 2 - Cloning a project:

Cloning is used for grabbing a repository from some remote location and downloading locally.  This is helpful when contributing to projects you do not own; however, it is also great in the case you mess up your local files and require a download of a backup. Follow the directions as follows to clone this repository locally:

##### Step 1 - Open the terminal:

Simply open the terminal and cd to where you would like to have the repo stored.  Note that the final command will make a folder to enclose any downloaded materials, so there is no need to create an enclosing folder.

##### Step 2 - Copy the clone link:

Navigate to the repository page and click the green code button.  Then copy the url under the https section, like as follows:
